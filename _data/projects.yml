- name: Global Data Ethics Project
  descr: "Global Data Ethics Project (GDEP)reflects the complexity of the community-based, multi-stakeholder work that took place over several years. The Data for Good Exchange conferences have served as a regular assembly point for the community to gather in person, punctuating months of research, meetings, and in-depth discussions that individual working groups engaged in and contributed to using digital tools, including GitHub, online discussions, teleconferences and social media, to build the principles from the ground-up. This ensured that people who could not be physically present at a D4GX conference could still contribute their significant insights and perspectives to the ethical discussion. At D4GX 2017, Lilian Huang of the University of Chicago and Natalie Evans Harris organized the initial call for working groups, simultaneously announcing it on social media and in D4D's Slack. Volunteers formed seven working groups, focused on different aspects of data ethics, and I led the following:
    Thought Diversity: Margeaux Spring
    Transparency and Openness: Abhijeet Chavan & Margeaux Spring"

- name: CityVoice
  descr: "The Civic Data Alliance, modified and updated the CityVoice application help government entities collect resident feedback about pedestrian safety coinciding with a revamp of a key corridor in our community, Dixie Highway. Through this deployment of CityVoice, we hope that we will be able to collect feedback from residents who might not be able to make it to a community meeting about the project. We will also be getting direct citizen feedback while they are physically in and experiencing the traffic corridor about which we want feedback."
